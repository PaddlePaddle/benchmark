# YOLO: You Only Look Once [1][2][3]

Currently V3 is implemented with training/evaluation/testing.

Random shape training is available through
```bash
python3 train_yolo3.py -h
```

Random shape training requires more GPU memory, but it provides better models. Alternatively, a normal fixed shape training is available as
```bash
python3 train_yolo3.py --no-random-shape
```
